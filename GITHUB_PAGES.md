# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to deploy the Route Visualization App to GitHub Pages. Since GitHub Pages only supports static websites, we've created a version that clearly indicates it's using the secure API key handling approach.

## Current Version

**Version: 1.0.0-secure** - *API keys are secure and Map is loaded properly*

This version includes:
- A version badge in the UI
- Clear indication that API keys are securely handled
- Server-side proxy for API requests

## Deployment Steps

1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Push your code to the repository
3. Go to the repository settings
4. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section
5. Select the branch you want to deploy (usually `main` or `master`)
6. Click Save

## Important Notes

- The GitHub Pages version is for demonstration purposes only
- For full functionality with secure API key handling, use the server-side version locally
- The version badge and security indicators help users understand they're using the secure version

## Updating the Deployment

After making changes to your code:

1. Commit and push your changes to GitHub
2. GitHub Pages will automatically update your site

## Live Demo

Once deployed, your application will be available at:
`https://your-username.github.io/route-visualization-app/`

Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.
